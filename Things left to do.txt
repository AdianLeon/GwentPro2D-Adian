Things left to do in the Gwent-Pro Project:
     -Change all the PlayerPrefs to a custom static class that holds all of the important info
     -Change the public accesors in Card and all Card scripts
     -Check through the whole project changing all non settable fields to properties and initialize them inside a constructor
     -Compiler does not admits the access to properties of cards if they are not variables example code: power=context.Hand.Pop().Power;
     -Make the foreach accept the context's lists of cards as the collection to iterate from
     -Eliminate the ambiguity container/cardList
     -Comparisons and boolean expressions are not recursive, which means (3<5)&&(2==3) aren't compiled, but (true==true) are
